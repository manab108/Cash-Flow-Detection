# Cash-Flow-Detection
The project is designed to minimize the number of financial transactions needed among multiple entities, either banks or individuals, to settle their debts. The primary goal is to reduce the complexity and number of transactions by optimizing how these debts are settled, considering constraints such as different payment modes for banks and all available payment methods for personal transactions.
